    <h3 class="text-5xl mb-7 font-semibold">API for Product Managers</h3>
    <h3 class="text-xl">Created By : <span class="italic">Onez Chowdhury</span></h3>
    <h3 class="text-xl mt-7 font-bold">What is API?</h3>
    <br>
    <p>An API, or Application Programming Interface, is a set of tools and protocols for building software and applications. It specifies how software components should interact, and allows for communication between different systems. (Set of guidelines or rules that state how applications interact)
       <br>
       <br>
        APIs can be used to access web-based services such as social media sites, weather services, and online databases. As a product manager, understanding how to use APIs can help you integrate external resources and services into your product, and can also help you understand how to build your own APIs to provide value to other companies and developers.
        <br>
        <br>

        There are several types of APIs, including web-based APIs, operating system APIs, library APIs, and database APIs. REST (Representational State Transfer) and SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) are the two most common types of web APIs.</p>
<h2 class="mt-2 font-bold">Components</h2>
<p>Mainly there are three main components of an API are Request, Response, and Resource. You would make a <span class="font-bold">request</span>to a server. The server will return a <span class="font-bold">response</span>that will contain data regarding a **resource**.

    For example, if you want to place a new order for a shirt in an e-commerce store, you would click on the "place order" button. When you click on that button, your browser sends a **request** to the e-commerce server. The e-commerce server will send a **response** to your browser after creating a new order, which is the <span class="font-bold"> resource</span>in this case.</p>
    <ol class="list-decimal pl-8">
        <li class="mb-2">Client: A device that requests data from a server. For example: Web Apps, Mobile Apps.</li>
        <li class="mb-2">Server: A computer with software installed which allows performing a service on a network. For example: An application server.</li>
        <li class="mb-2">Request: When a client asks a server to send data or process data.</li>
        <li>Response: Sent back by the server on each request. A response can contain structured data or an indication that data has been processed.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2 class="mt-2 font-bold">What is cURL?</h2>
<p>cURL is a command-line tool that allows a developer to quickly test an API. So instead of building a UI to see the data returned by an API developers can use cURL, in the command line, to quickly send a request and view the data retuned by the API.</p>


<h2 class="mt-2 font-bold">What is Method?</h2>
<p>A method refers to the type of request being made by the client to a server. The most common methods are GET, POST, PUT and DELETE. GET method is used to retrieve information from the server, POST method is used to submit information to the server, PUT method is used to update information on the server and DELETE method is used to delete information on the server.</p>
